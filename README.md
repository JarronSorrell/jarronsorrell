# 🧬 Interactive qPCR Visualization with Generative AI

This is a live portfolio project by **Jarron Sorrell** showcasing how generative AI tools can be used to create an **interactive scientific visualization** — specifically, **qPCR amplification curves** for the DASH SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A/B Test.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This site explores the intersection of biotechnology and artificial intelligence. It includes:
- Educational explanations of qPCR
- The use of generative AI for code and data synthesis
- A live, interactive visualization powered by Plotly and vanilla JavaScript
- Toggle controls, log/linear scale switching, and auto-calculated Ct values

---

## 🔬 Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **Plotly.js** for scientific chart rendering
- **Generative AI (GPT + Claude)** for data synthesis and code scaffolding
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

---

## 📊 Interactive Visualization Features

- **Realistic Amplification Curves** for multiple targets (SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B)
- **Log/Linear Scale Toggle** for better curve analysis
- **Automatic Ct Value Calculation**
- **Results Table with Color-Coded Pos/Neg Interpretation**
- **Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop viewing

---

## 💡 How It Works

All data is synthetically generated using biologically plausible models. The visualization was adapted from an AI-generated React component and converted into a GitHub Pages–compatible HTML implementation using:
- Prompt engineering
- Data modeling with sigmoidal amplification curves
- HTML/CSS/JS integration scripting
